# **Abstract**

This topic has been discussed in various ways such as addressing the
urban issues including the land shortages and traffic problems within
the city. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to show the key
role of urban planners in reducing the impact of buildings, especially
high-rise buildings. For instance, they can evaluate the possible
capacity of the urban environment before the starting of construction
projects at different levels. In this research, which is of analytical
and experimental type, by using a process to assess the traffic effects
as a pilot study, the traffic quality factor of networks and service
level is provided. According to which the traffic effects caused by the
High-rise Buildings are determined by the related indicators.

# **Value of the data**

***Why are these data useful?***

In this modern world, the high-rise building-related matters seem to be
significant as a fundamental phenomenon. This topic has been discussed
in various ways such as addressing the urban issues including the land
shortages and traffic problems within the city. For this reason, this
study aims to improve the quality of access to the surrounding road
network by emphasizing the sustainability of the environment and tries
to show that we can reduce many of the city’s traffic problems by
planning, gaining awareness of related issues such as urban traffic
problems, considering comprehensive decisions about high-rises and
assessment of their traffic effects.

***Who can benefit from these data?***

If the planning and the location process of high-rise buildings are
commensurate with the use of the transportation network and urban
environment we can expect that a great number of problems related to
urban traffic will be mitigated and will be considered as a step towards
a sustainable environment and integrated land use and transportation
planning.

***How can these data be used/reused for further insights and/or
development of experiments?***

According to the data and in accordance with the macro and micro
objectives of the research, the following strategies have been
presented:  
Strategy 1: Empowerment following the access quality  
Strategy 2: assessment of terrain belonging to the high-rise buildings
on the quality of access to the road network  
Policies and strategies such as raising awareness, conducting the
necessary surveys, and municipal policies have been presented in order
to reduce the traffic passing through the main streets, which can be
used in further works.

# **Experimental design, materials and methods**

The method of this research is based on the subject and objectives of
the study, also a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods of
analytical evaluation. The information has been collected through
documentary, library, and field studies. Research steps and data
collection tools of the current research include a) Documentary and
library studies (including table and form, map, computer file), b)
operational and field survey (including observation, photography, and
counting of vehicles), c (Analysis, d) Evaluation, e) Conclusion and
answering the research questions. For this purpose, Alton and Salman
towers as case studies, are high-rise buildings which are will be
evaluated along with the scope of intervention in order to achieve the
goal by the desired criteria, the possibilities, and limitations and the
SWAT qualitative analysis method. At the first step, the criteria will
be weighed with the aid of the AHP analytical method and Expert Choice
software. Then, they will be analyzed through the spatial data
information system (GIS software) from the aspect of traffic effects in
the area around each of the case studies. The results will be mapped
based on the criteria. In the second step, the available tolerable
capacity of the access network will be calculated and the existing
service level of the roads will be compared with the Standard service
level. Finally, some strategies and policies will be presented to
improve the traffic condition using various analytical methods.
