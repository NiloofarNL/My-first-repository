Learning how to create a repository


## Introduction


I am working on using R and Github as the data collecting methods as a graduate student. Before this program I was working on urban planning issues when I was studying for a bachelor degree. Here is a brief table of my academic degrees.

Program | Degree | Duration
-| - | -
Urban Engineering | Bachelor | 4 years
Geography | M.Sc. | 2 years

# ***Research Interest***
***
My research interests lie in the intersection of Urban Planning and Geographic Information System (GIS). Particularly, land use distribution, transportation planning, and spatial analysis are my major interests. Since I have been always keen on vegetation analysis and natural disasters, I have taken a Complete Remote Sensing course in Udemy. In fact, I aim to develop these scopes to open new horizons and correspond these fields with more practical and feasible applications to address today issues. As a result, I have achieved a large variety of related skills. Indeed, I have fostered my interests in collaboration with prestigious companies and urban organizations.  
In my dissertation, I researched the traffic effects of high-rise buildings on the access network around them which have been resulted in an essay as the extraction of my graduation degree. Being enthralled in these contexts, soon after graduation, I wrote another essay obtained from the course “urban issues seminar” about the evaluation of accessibility to sports land use with network analysis method and locating new sports spaces in zone 1 of Mashhad by AHP and Expert Choice.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:  

# ***A Chunk of Code***
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

```{r testing-arguments, eval = FALSE}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
